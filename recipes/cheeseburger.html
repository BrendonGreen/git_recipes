<ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons of unsalted butter (room temperature)</li>
    <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
    <li>1 lb. 85/15 ground beef</li>
    <li>1.5 teaspoon salt</li>

    <li>Spread the butter on the inside of each hamburger bun.</li>
    <li>Heat a large skillet over medium/high heat and toast the hamburger buns for 2-3 minutes or until they become golden brown. Set aside.</li>
